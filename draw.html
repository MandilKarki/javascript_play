<!-- Here is the explanation of each line of code:

    <!DOCTYPE html>: This is a declaration of the type of document being used. It indicates that this is an HTML document.

    <html>: This is the start of an HTML document.

    <head>: This is the head section of the HTML document. The head section contains information about the document, such as the
         title and style, but does not contain the content of the document.

    <style>: This section of the head contains the styles for the document. In this case, it sets the margin and padding of 
        the body to 0.

    <body>: This is the body section of the HTML document. This section contains the content of the document.

    <canvas id="myCanvas"></canvas>: This creates a canvas element in the HTML document with the ID myCanvas.

    const canvas = document.getElementById("myCanvas");: This line of code uses the getElementById method to get the canvas 
    element with the ID myCanvas and assigns it to the constant canvas.

    const ctx = canvas.getContext("2d");: This line of code creates a 2D rendering context for the canvas and assigns it to
     the constant ctx.

    canvas.width = window.innerWidth;: This line of code sets the width of the canvas to the inner width of the window.

    canvas.height = window.innerHeight;: This line of code sets the height of the canvas to the inner height of the window.

    const shapeWidth = 100;: This line of code creates a constant named shapeWidth with a value of 100. This value is used as the
     width of the rectangle and the diameter of the circle.

    const shapeHeight = 100;: This line of code creates a constant named shapeHeight with a value of 100. This value is used as the
     height of the rectangle.

    let shape = "rectangle";: This line of code creates a variable named shape with a value of "rectangle". This variable is used to
     determine whether the current shape to be drawn is a rectangle or a circle.

    function draw() {: This line of code starts the definition of the draw function. This function is used to draw the rectangles
         and circles on the canvas.

    ctx.clearRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);: This line of code uses the clearRect method of the ctx object to clear the 
    entire canvas.

    const x = Math.floor(Math.random() * (canvas.width - shapeWidth));: This line of code creates a constant named x with a random
     value between 0 and canvas.width - shapeWidth. This value is used as the x-coordinate of the top-left corner of the rectangle
      or the x-coordinate of the center of the circle.

    const y = Math.floor(Math.random() * (canvas.height - shapeHeight));: This line of code creates a constant named y with a random
     value between 0 and canvas.height - shapeHeight. -->


     <!--     const canvas = document.getElementById("myCanvas"); - this line retrieves the canvas element from the HTML document using
       its ID "myCanvas".

    const ctx = canvas.getContext("2d"); - this line creates a 2D rendering context for the canvas.

    canvas.width = window.innerWidth; and canvas.height = window.innerHeight; - this sets the canvas width and height to the size of 
    the browser window.

    const shapeWidth = 100; and const shapeHeight = 100; - this sets the constant width and height of the shapes that will be 
    drawn on the canvas.

    let shape = "rectangle"; - this sets a variable shape to "rectangle" which determines the type of shape to be drawn on the canvas.

    function draw() { - this is a function that will be called every 500ms to redraw the shapes on the canvas.

    ctx.clearRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height); - this line clears the entire canvas so that the shapes are drawn fresh every
     time the function is called.

    const x = Math.floor(Math.random() * (canvas.width - shapeWidth)); and const y = Math.floor(Math.random() * (canvas.height - shapeHeight)); -
     this generates random x and y coordinates for the shapes to be drawn on the canvas.

    ctx.beginPath(); - this starts a new path for the shapes to be drawn on.

    if (shape === "rectangle") { ctx.rect(x, y, shapeWidth, shapeHeight); } - this line checks if the shape is a rectangle and draws
     it if it is.

    else { ctx.arc(x + shapeWidth / 2, y + shapeHeight / 2, shapeWidth / 2, 0, 2 * Math.PI); } - this line draws an arc (circle) 
    if the shape is not a rectangle.

    ctx.fillStyle = randomColor(); - this sets the fill style of the shape to a random color generated by the randomColor() function.

    ctx.fill(); - this fills the shape with the fill style set in the previous step.

    ctx.closePath(); - this closes the path for the shapes.

    shape = shape === "rectangle" ? "circle" : "rectangle"; - this line sets the shape variable to either "circle" or "rectangle" 
    alternatively to draw different shapes on the canvas.

    function randomNumber(min, max) { return Math.floor(Math.random() * (max - min + 1)) + min; } - this function generates a random
     number between a given minimum and maximum value.

    function randomColor() { return rgb(${randomNumber(0, 255)}, ${randomNumber(0, 255)}, ${randomNumber(0, 255)}); } - this function
     generates a random RGB color value.

    setInterval(draw, 500); - this line sets the interval for calling the draw() function every 500ms to redraw the shapes on the
     canvas. -->
